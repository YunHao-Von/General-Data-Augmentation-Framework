# General-Data-Augmentation-Framework
This is a general data augmentation framework for deep learning. It can use data crawler to get the data you want from the web. Our framework use a self-filtering to identify outliers and noisy images in the raw data. And we choose style-gan and co-ming(self-supervised) to get labels.
